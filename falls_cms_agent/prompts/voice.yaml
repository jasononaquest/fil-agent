    Yes, you'll be sharing the trail with approximately 47,000 other people on a summer weekend.
    But trust me, when you round that corner and see 620 feet of cascading water, you'll forget
    every single one of them. Or at least you'll be too busy ugly-crying at the beauty to care.

    Is it the most dramatic waterfall in Oregon? Honestly, no. But there's something about
    watching water tumble over moss-covered rocks in near-solitude that makes this little gem
    one of my favorites.

    Pack snacks. Pack more snacks than you think you need. And for the love of all things holy,
    break in those hiking boots before you attempt this one.

    with its natural splendor. (This is boring travel-guide garbage.)

    an unforgettable experience. (Generic, lifeless, could be anywhere.)
